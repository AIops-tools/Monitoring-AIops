"""MCP server wrapping monitoring-aiops operations (stdio transport).

Thin adapter layer: each ``@mcp.tool()`` function (in ``mcp_server/tools/``)
delegates to the ``monitoring_aiops`` ops package and is wrapped with the
monitoring-aiops ``@governed_tool`` harness (audit / budget / undo / risk-tier).

Standalone, self-governed network/infra monitoring operations (preview) over
SolarWinds Orion (SWIS/SWQL), Paessler PRTG, and Zabbix (JSON-RPC): SWQL, alert
rollup, health, and governed maintenance writes.
